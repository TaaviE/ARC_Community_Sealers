# ARC_Community_Sealers
Lists compiled by the ARC community to help with adoption

## community_sealer_whitelist

A list of known legitimate ARC Sealing d= domains.

"Legitimate" means the d= domain is known to:
* Properly evaluate and record email authentication for received messages
* Properly encode those authentication results in the AAR
* Properly Seal their outbound modified mail

## community_outreach_list

A list of known d= domains which do not yet implement ARC or do not yet meet all the above criteria to pass the "legitimate" threshold. The community believes domains on this list would be well served by properly ARC Sealing outbound mail which they modify.
